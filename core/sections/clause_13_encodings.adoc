== Requirements Classes for Encodings of Zone data and Zone list

This standard does not mandate any particular encoding or format in which to return the `../dggs/zones` and `../dggs/zones/{zoneId}/data` resources.
DGGS Zone Data and Zone Lists can be encoded in any suitable data format.
However, it does define requirements class for encodings which are expected to be commonly supported in implementations of this standard.
These requirements classes include:

*For zone data:*

* <<rc_data-geojson,GeoJSON Data>>
* <<rc_data-geotiff,GeoTIFF Data>>
* <<rc_data-netcdf,netCDF Data>>
* <<rc_data-coveragejson,CoverageJSON Data>>
* <<rc_data-jpegxl,JPEG XL Data>>
* <<rc_data-png,PNG Data>>

*For zone list:*

* <<rc_zone-html,HTML Zone List>>
* <<rc_zone-json,JSON Zone List>>
* <<rc_zone-binary64bit,64-bit Binary Zone List>>
* <<rc_zone-geojson,GeoJSON Zone List>>
* <<rc_zone-geotiff,GeoTIFF Zone List>>

=== Zone data encodings

==== Requirements Class "GeoTIFF Zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The GeoTIFF requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-008r4/19-008r4.html[OGC GeoTIFF standard].

GeoTIFF is a commonly used format for representing 2-dimensional gridded coverages.

For a DGGS with non-rectangular zones (e.g., hexagonal zones), a GeoTIFF representation can be the minimal bounding rectangle of the zone shape, with NODATA values used outside the bounds of the zone.

==== Requirements Class "GeoJSON Zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The GeoJSON requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON specification].

GeoJSON is a commonly used format for representing features with simple geometries and related properties.
GeoJSON is simple to understand and well supported by tools and software libraries.
Since most Web developers are comfortable with using JSON-based formats, supporting GeoJSON is recommended for a vector representation of DGGS Zone data.

==== Requirements Class "netCDF zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The netCDF requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=43732[OGC netCDF standard].

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_data_netcdf.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "CoverageJSON zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The CoverageJSON requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://docs.ogc.org/cs/21-069r2/21-069r2.html[OGC CoverageJSON Community Standard].

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_data_coveragejson.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "JPEG-XL Zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The JPEG XL requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/[JPEG XL] https://www.iso.org/standard/77977.html[ISO/IEC 18181 Standard].

JPEG XL supports a large number of bands, image dimensions, and floating point values.

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_data_jpegxl.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "PNG Zone data encoding"

===== Overview

The PNG requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone data response according to the https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/[W3C Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification] (https://www.iso.org/standard/29581.html[ISO/IEC 15948:2003]).

Because PNG encoding is limited to an integer data values, this requirements class defines additional parameters and response headers allowing a client to request
a specific scale factor and offset to be used to quantize data values, and allowing the implementation to inform the client of the scale factor and offset
used for that quantization.

=== Zone list encodings

==== Requirements Class "JSON zone list encoding"

===== Overview

The JSON zone list encoding requirements class defines the ability to retrieve a JSON response for the DGGS zone list resource.

The response consists of a simple JSON object with a `"zones"` array property listing the zone identifiers as strings.
The object can also include a `"links"` objects linking back to other resources of the DGGS.

This requirement class provides an easy to implement, reasonably efficient and interoperable mechanism to exchange lists of zone identifiers.

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_list_json.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "HTML zone list encoding"

===== Overview

The HTML zone list encoding requirements class defines at a high level the ability to retrieve an HTML response for the DGGS zone list resource intended primarily for users accessing the API from a Web browser.

The exact content of the HTML response is not prescribed, leaving the flexibility for implementations to choose a preferred approach.

HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web. An API that supports HTML will support browsing the spatial resources with a web browser and will also enable search engines to crawl and index those resources.

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_list_html.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "Binary 64-bit integer zone list encoding"

===== Overview

The binary 64-bit integer zone list encoding requirements class defines the ability to retrieve a binary response for the DGGS zone list resource for
DGGRS whose zone identifiers can be expressed as a single 64-bit integer.

The response consists of a 64-bit integer count of zones, followed by that count of zones, also 64-bit integers.
With compact zones and additional HTTP content encoding compression, this provides an optimal way to exchange DGGS zone lists.

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_list_binary_64bit.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "GeoJSON zone list encoding"

===== Overview

The GeoJSON zone list encoding requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone list response according to the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON specification].

The response is a feature collection where each feature represents a zone in the list.
The geometry of the zone shold be polygons or multipolygons (e.g., in the case of zone geometry which must be split on the anti-meridian or pole).
The zone identifier is represented in the `id` field of each feature.

While not intended to efficiently exchange zone list, as the response carries the geometry of the zones which could easily be computed client-side which takes considerable bandwidth and is
not necessary for a DGGS client working natively with the same DGGRS, this requirement class provides an easy way to readily visualize the response in a variety of tools.
This requirements class is therefore intended for convenience, demonstration and educational purposes.

// TODO: include::requirements/requirements_class_zone_list_geojson.adoc[]

==== Requirements Class "GeoTIFF zone list encoding"

===== Overview

The GeoTIFF zone list encoding requirements class defines support for encoding a DGGS Zone list response according to the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-008r4/19-008r4.html[OGC GeoTIFF standard],
intended primarily for DGGS with rectangular zones.

The response is a 2D gridded coverage where each cell is a zone in the list, in the coordinate reference system of that DGGS.

For DGGS with non-rectangular zones, the resolution would need to be higher than a single pixel per the most detailed zone to be returned in order to be able to recognize the zone geometry,
and would therefore be very sub-optimal. While for rectangular zones it would be easy to identify zones with a one-to-one correspondence, recognizing non-rectangular zones would be significantly more difficult.

While not intended to efficiently exchange zone list, this requirement class provides an easy way to readily visualize the response in a variety of tools.
This requirements class is therefore intended for convenience, demonstration and educational purposes.
