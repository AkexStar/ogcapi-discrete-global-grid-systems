== DGGS - Data Retrieval Conformance Class

=== Overview

The Data Retrieval conformance class allows to retrieve data from a specific
Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) in a particular indexing scheme from an individual zone.
It describes an HTTP GET operation, as well as its response.
The selected DGGS is listed as available and described in the Core conformance class,
and conforms to OGC Topic 21.

The data for a particular zone is retrieved based on a URI template including
a variable representing a Zone ID.

The resource from which data is retrieved can either be
for a particular collection of geospatial data, for a dataset as a whole, or
in connection with _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows & Chaining_, the output of
a processing workflow.
