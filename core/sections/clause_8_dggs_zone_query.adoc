== Requirement Class "Zone Query"

=== Overview

The Zone Query conformance class allows to request the list of DGGS zones from a specific
Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) in a particular indexing scheme for which there is
data available, or matching a particular query (e.g., using a filtering parameter).
It describes an HTTP GET operation, as well as its response.
The selected DGGS is listed as available and described in the Core conformance class,
and conforms to OGC Topic 21.
The list of zones from a Web API using this conformance class can either be
for a particular collection of geospatial data, for a dataset as a whole, or
in connection with _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows & Chaining_, the output of
a processing workflow.
