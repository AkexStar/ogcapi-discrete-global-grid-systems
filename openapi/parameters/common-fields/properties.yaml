  ```
  PropertiesSpec:     "properties"=field[,fieldName]*
  field:              {fieldName}|{fieldIndex}
  fieldName:          {text}
  fieldIndex:         {number}

  Where:
     {number} is an integer number, and
     {text} is some general ASCII text.
  ```

  The field name must be one of the id defined in the RangeType DataRecord fields or feature properties schema.

  Complex expressions may also be supported instead of fields to define derived fields, potentially also
  including the possibility to use aggregation functons.
