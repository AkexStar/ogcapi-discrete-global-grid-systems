=== Requirement Class DGGS - Multi-Zone Data Retrieval

The Multi-Zone Data Retrieval conformance class allows to retrieve data from a specific
Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) in a particular indexing scheme from a list of zones
referenced by ID.
It describes an HTTP GET operation, as well as its response.
The selected DGGS is listed as available and described in the Core conformance class,
and conforms to OGC Topic 21.
The conformance makes use of URI templates for a variable representing the Zone ID.
The data retrieved from a Web API using this conformance class can either be
for a particular collection of geospatial data, for a dataset as a whole, or
in connection with _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows & Chaining_, the output of
a processing workflow.
